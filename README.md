This space is a reflection of my journey through finance, AI, and other areas that spark my curiosity. I use GitHub as a platform for continuous exploration and learning, primarily focusing on open-source projects that push the boundaries of innovation in the digital world.

Feel free to look around and see what Iâ€™ve been working on. While some of my projects are still in development, Iâ€™ll be making them public once theyâ€™re fully ready to deploy. If youâ€™re interested in anything or have feedback, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
